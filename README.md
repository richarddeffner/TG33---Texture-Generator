## Where to start?
*"You're about to enter an exciting new world of vector synthesis combining sample playback and tone generation. Vector synthesis allows you to create and control synthesized sound with unprecedented ease - in a very intimate, "human" way, putting you more closely in touch with your music. [...] The more you use the TG33, the more [...] it will become an indispensable part of your musical repertoire."* <br /> (Yamaha TG33 Manual)  <br />

## Requirements
In order to use the **TG33** you need a [Max for Live](https://www.ableton.com/de/live/max-for-live/) licence and [Live](https://www.ableton.com/de/live/).
